"Smart Meeting Room"<br>

We have decided to create 4 smart service which is;<br>
1. Smart Door<br>
2. Smart Projector<br>
3. Smart Assistant<br>
4. Smart Chair<br>

each service will have a very unique and different function.<br>

Smart Door - User will be able to open automatic and counting the people before it close the door.<br>

Smart Projector - User will allow user to turn ON and OFF and choose the connection between HDMI or VGA.<br>

Smart Assistant - User will allow record the meeting and ending the record, another function is to send the report to the person in the meeting via email. <br>

Smart Chair - User will allow the user to change their seat temperature and to push the chair up or down depending on the user need.<br>

We hopefully this can be the best idea for the future.<br>
